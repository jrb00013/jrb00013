# Joseph Black - B.S. in Computer Engineering | Interests and Skills in: Autonomous Systems, Software Design, Embedded Systems, Robotics, PLC Design Basics, Cybersecurity and Firmware Security

Hi I'm Joseph Black!

I'm a 2025 Computer Engineering graduate from West Virginia University with a strong interest in embedded systems, automation, and cybersecurity. I‚Äôve worked on real-time robotics, firmware development, and low-level C programming, including projects involving designing operating systems, utilizing up to date industry standard frameworks like ROS2 and FreeRTOS, handling buffer overflows, and optimizing motor control. I was a team lead for an autonomous racing team, and I also was a research intern who worked on pushing the boundaries of path planning algorithms. I worked outside as a maintence employee for a cemetery for years all while attending school and earning SAS certifications in data analysis and statistical decision-making. I'm passionate about building practical, AI-powered embedded systems and always looking to grow through challenges.

Some of my skills and interests are listed below. I have links to some of my uploaded project code by which I recently started pushing updates to again.

Have a good day.

## Projects

### **F1TENTH Autonomous Racing**  
- Led the development of a 1/10th scale autonomous race car as part of WVU's F1TENTH team, achieving 2nd place at the 19th IEEE International F1TENTH Grand Prix. Engineered and tuned custom PID control loops for throttle and steering using VESC firmware, dramatically improving control precision and stability at high speeds. Implemented real-time path planning algorithms including pure pursuit, gap following, and dynamic obstacle avoidance using ROS2, Python, and LiDAR sensor fusion. Served as technical lead, learning ROS2 independently and training team members on framework integration, algorithm deployment, and hardware communication protocols.

### **ASM x86 Real Mode OS**  
- Created a fully functional bootable operating system written in pure x86 assembly, designed to run in real mode on legacy x86 architecture. Developed a custom 512-byte bootloader that initializes CPU, loads kernel from disk using BIOS INT 13h, and implements a command-line shell with keyboard input handling. Integrated FAT12 file system parsing, custom interrupt handlers through IVT modification, and basic memory management with segment:offset addressing. Successfully deployed on PlayStation 2 hardware using Free McBoot and DMS3 modchip, demonstrating low-level hardware interaction and embedded system design principles.

### **MSP432 Microcontroller Robot**  
- Created a fully functional bootable operating system written in pure x86 assembly, designed to run in real mode on legacy x86 architecture. Developed a custom 512-byte bootloader that initializes CPU, loads kernel from disk using BIOS INT 13h, and implements a command-line shell with keyboard input handling. Integrated FAT12 file system parsing, custom interrupt handlers through IVT modification, and basic memory management with segment:offset addressing. Successfully deployed on PlayStation 2 hardware using Free McBoot and DMS3 modchip, demonstrating low-level hardware interaction and embedded system design principles.

### **MPX OS Kernel**  
- Designed and implemented a bare-metal cooperative multitasking OS kernel using C and x86 assembly, mimicking early embedded RTOS architectures with precise timing and interrupt control. Developed custom interrupt service routines, system call interfaces, and process management using Process Control Blocks (PCBs) and Memory Control Blocks (MCBs). Implemented full context-switching mechanisms managing register states and stack frames, along with modular shell support, serial drivers (polling and interrupt modes), software timers, and real-time I/O scheduling without relying on existing operating systems.

### **Aamati: Machine Learning VST3 Audio Filtering / Layering Plugin**  
- Currently developing an intelligent VST3 audio plugin using JUCE framework (C++) and PyTorch for real-time drum rhythm manipulation based on psychoacoustic analysis. Implements machine learning-driven rhythm morphing that dynamically adjusts grooves using energy, intensity, and mood detection. Features real-time MIDI/audio analysis, perception-driven groove engine, and interactive UI for frequency filtering and energy modulation. Trained on labeled MIDI datasets with plans for LSTM/RNN integration and cross-DAW compatibility for professional music production environments.

### **VHDL-Based CPU Design**  
- Engineered a custom 8-bit CPU from scratch using VHDL, emphasizing instruction-level control and finite state machine design. Created custom instruction set, hardcoded ALU, register file, and memory-mapped I/O interface with ModelSim simulation for timing analysis. Implemented FSMs for instruction fetch/decode/execute cycles, addressing real-world timing constraints including clock domain crossing and synchronous resets. Designed architecture supports basic arithmetic, logic operations, and I/O interfacing, laying groundwork for future FPGA-based projects.

###  **ExamJam**  
- Developed a full-stack collaborative study platform specifically designed for West Virginia University students, providing free access to course-organized flashcards and study materials. Built using React.js frontend with Firebase authentication and MySQL backend, featuring dynamic search functionality, class-based organization, and responsive UI design. Implemented secure user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and intuitive course categorization to eliminate paywalls common in commercial study apps. Collaborated in an Agile development environment with Git version control, contributing to architectural design, component logic, and testing infrastructure.

### **Discord Call of Duty Statistics Bot**  
- Developed and deployed a feature-rich Discord bot for gaming community management, integrating with Call of Duty API (https://codapi.dev/) to track ranked play statistics. Implemented RESTful API communication, asynchronous programming patterns, and real-time message parsing for interactive user commands. Features modular event-driven architecture with comprehensive error handling, logging systems, and live testing protocols. Maintains active deployment with version control and community-driven feature updates. 

### **Keke RTOS App**  
- Currently developing a lightweight real-time operating system that integrates AI decision-making with SQL database management for autonomous stock inventory control. Built using C/C++ with custom RTOS concepts, featuring priority-based task scheduling, message passing, and thread-safe inter-process communication. Incorporates SQLite for real-time inventory tracking and REST API integration for live stock data analysis. Implements AI-powered trend forecasting and autonomous reorder suggestions, simulating edge-device intelligence for IoT and logistics applications with local decision-making capabilities.
