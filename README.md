## üìù  About Me

I'm a junior engineer who just graduated from West Virginia University in 2025. I've worked on real-time robotics, OS and firmware development, automation tools, audio plugins, apps, and websites. I was a team lead for the WVU autonomous racing team, and I was also a Robotics Research Intern at the Intelligent Cyber-physical Systems Research Lab ([iCPS Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/amrselwakeel/intelligent-cyber-physical-systems-research-lab-icps-lab)) at WVU, who worked with utilizing sensor fusion data to develop efficient path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. I also have earned SAS certifications in data analysis and statistical decision-making that I have utilized in my ML-based projects. I'm interested in building dynamic AI-powered embedded systems and always looking to grow through the challenges that come with making them.

On top of my technical skills, I've also worked outside during my college summers as a maintence worker at my hometown cemetery, where I learned how to work with grit but also enjoy the little things while on the job. I'm thankful for the opportunities that I have.

Some of my skills and interests are listed below. I have links to some of my old uploaded projects by which I maintain the repos for and occasional update. I'm also working on a few new projects as well. 

Thanks for stopping by, enjoy your day!

  <summary><strong>F1TENTH Autonomous Racecar</strong></summary>

Led the development of a 1/10th scale autonomous race car as part of WVU's F1TENTH team, achieving 2nd place at the 19th IEEE International F1TENTH Grand Prix. Engineered and tuned custom PID control loops for throttle and steering using VESC firmware, dramatically improving control precision and stability at high speeds. Implemented real-time path planning algorithms including pure pursuit, gap following, and dynamic obstacle avoidance using ROS2, Python, and LiDAR sensor fusion. Served as technical lead, learning ROS2 independently and training team members on framework integration, algorithm deployment, and hardware communication protocols.

  <summary><strong>Lydlr: Multimodal Edge AI Compression System</strong></summary>

Currently designing a real-time multimodal sensor data compression system using ROS2 and PyTorch, targeting edge devices. At the moment, I'm deploying my nodes onto a Raspberry Pi, and eventually plan to utilize an NVIDIA Jetson. The system fuses camera, LiDAR, IMU, and audio inputs through convolutional and recurrent neural networks to achieve efficient learned compression with temporal context. Integrated a reinforcement learning-based adaptive compression controller that dynamically balances compression quality and system resource usage, guided by live perceptual quality assessment (LPIPS) and system metrics. I also prepared the data for quantization for AI edge hardware.
